This is a demo post to make sure the writers can actually write something that is coherent and useful.

There are lot's of fun things with this new website. Best avantage so far of using the jekyll template is that you can write blog posts using Markdown, which is so much friendlier than html. Yes, I'm pretty sure I last tried to write a website about 10 years ago when it was cool to use html.

I'm also liking the potential of having a website via Git, this means that collaboration on blogs, and other information will be collaborative. And, if for some reason we decide to not keep the website running, we will still have the files that made the website.
