subtitle: Where did this all start?

In March 2023 we organised a workshop on analytics applied to wastewater data for infectious diseases. A collection of people from across Europe and beyond spent two days presenting their ongoing work and discussing what research needs there are going forward. We all enjoyed the discussion so much we continued to meet approximately monthly, and wrote a paper describing where we think this field will go.

Leading on from this, we've thought about some of the guiding principles of this group.
